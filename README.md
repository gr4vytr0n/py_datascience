Steps in Data Science Process -- Iterative Process
* Step 1: Acquire Data
    - identify data sets
    - retrieve data
    - query data
* Step 2-A: Explore Data
    - Understand nature of data
    - Preliminary analysis
* Step 2-B: Pre-process Data
    - clean
    - integrate
    - package
* Step 3: Analyze Data
    - Select analytical techniques
    - Build Models
* Step 4: Communicate Results
    - Reports
    - Visualizations
* Step 5: Apply Results
    - purpose
    
Step 1: Acquire
    - Traditional databases -- SQL and query browsers
    - Text files -- scripting language
    - Remote data -- web services (XML, JSON, RSS, REST, SOAP, WebSocket)
    - NoSQL storage -- API / Web Services
    
Step 2-A: Explore
    - Understand data: correlations, general trends, outliers
    - Summary statistics (describe data): mode, median, mean, std. deviation, range
    - Visualization: heat maps, histogram, boxplots, line graphs, scatter plots

Step 2-B: Pre-processing Data
    - clean and transform
    - Quality: inconsistent values, duplicate records, missing values, invalid data, outliers
    - Addressing Data Quality issues (Domain Knowlege required):
        - remove data with missing values
        - merge duplicate records
        - generate best estimate for invalid values
        - remove outliers
    - Data preparation:
        - scaling: changing range of values (0 to 1, -1 to 1)
        - transformations: aggregation
        - feature selection: remove, combine, add features
        - dimensionality reduction: 3D -> 2D (principle component analysis)
        - data manipulation

Step 3: Analyze
    - Build a model: input data -> analysis technique -> MODEL -> model output
    - Categories of analysis techniques: classification, regression, clustering, association analysis, graph analytics
    - Classification: predict category of input data
    - Regression: predict numeric value
    - Clustering: organize similar items into groups
    - Association analysis: find rules to capture associations between items
    - Graph analytics: use graph structure to find connections between entities
    - Modeling: select techinique -> build model -> validate model
    - Validating techniques:
        - Classification and regression: predicted value versus correct value
        - Clustering: examine groups for applicable use
        - Association analysis and graph analytics: investigate results
    - Next steps: repeat analysis, take a deeper dive, act on results

Step 4: Report
    - What to present: main results, value of these results to domain, success criteria
    - Answer questions in report
    - May be inconclusive/puzzling results, may not be as expected
    - Don't stretch the truth about results
    - Visualizations: graphs, tables
    
Step 5: Act
    - Findings
    - Implementations
    - <-> process <-> automation <-> stakeholders <->
    - Evaluate: favorable results, revisist, further opportunities, real-time actions
